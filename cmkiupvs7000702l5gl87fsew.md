Every time I read Daniel chapter 4, I notice something different. This time, it is how patient God was with King Nebuchadnezzar. How many chances He gave him. How long He waited before finally saying, “Enough.”

The king’s story is not just an old Bible story about some ruler I will never meet. It is my story too. Because I struggle with the same thing he struggled with—thinking too highly of myself and forgetting that everything I have comes from God.

**Daniel 4:34** says, *“After this time had passed, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven. My sanity returned, and I praised and worshiped the Most High and honored the one who lives forever.”* (NLT)

What gets me about this verse is the part where it says “looked up to heaven.” For seven years, the king had been looking down—eating grass like an animal, living outside, completely crazy. But when he finally looked up, everything changed. His mind came back. His kingdom came back. His life came back.

Looking up made all the difference.

## The King Who Forgot Where His Power Came From

Nebuchadnezzar ruled a huge empire. He had everything—money, armies, power, cities that made other countries jealous. But somewhere along the way, he started believing it all came from him instead of from God.

I catch myself doing the same thing.

When things are going well, I start thinking I am doing pretty good. I make plans. I fix problems. I get stuff done. And slowly, without even noticing, I start giving myself all the credit. I forget that every good thing I have—every door that opens, every prayer that gets answered, every bit of energy to keep going—comes from God.

**Daniel 4:30** shows exactly what was in the king’s head: *“Look at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendor.”* (NLT)

He really believed his own power built everything. How many times have I thought something similar? How many times have I looked at something good in my life and thought, “I worked hard for this. I earned this. I did this”? Probably more times than I want to admit.

## God Gave Him Lots of Chances

Here is what really gets me about this story. God did not just suddenly punish Nebuchadnezzar out of nowhere. He gave him warning after warning. Chance after chance.

In Daniel 2, God gave the king a dream that showed him the future. Daniel explained it to him, and the king even said, *“Truly, your God is the greatest of gods, the Lord over kings.”* (Daniel 2:47, NLT)

But nothing changed in his heart.

Then in Daniel 3, God did an amazing miracle right in front of him. Three men thrown into a hot furnace walked out without a scratch. The king saw it with his own eyes. He even made an announcement honoring God.

But still, his pride did not go away.

I see myself doing this. God shows me He is faithful over and over. He answers my prayers. He gives me what I need. He keeps me safe from things I do not even know about. And for a little while, I am thankful. I say thanks. I remember His goodness.

But then life gets busy again. Things go okay. And I forget. I go back to thinking I can handle everything myself.

## The Dream That Was a Last Warning

Finally, in Daniel 4, God gave Nebuchadnezzar one more warning. This time through a dream that really scared him. He saw a huge tree that went up to the sky, giving food and shelter to everyone. Then a voice from heaven said to cut it down and leave only the stump.

Daniel had to tell the king what the dream meant. And you can tell it was hard for him. **Daniel 4:19** says Daniel was really upset when he figured out what it meant. He actually cared about the king, even though the king was not exactly a good person.

Daniel told him straight up: *“Please take my advice. Stop doing wrong and do what is right. Stop being mean to people and help the poor instead. Maybe then things will keep going well for you.”* (Daniel 4:27, NLT)

Then God gave him twelve more months. A whole year to change. A whole year to stop being so proud and avoid what was coming.

But he did not change.

Exactly one year later, the king was walking on his palace roof, looking at his city, and bragging about how he built it all by himself. And right then, in the middle of him showing off, God’s judgment came.

**Daniel 4:31-33** tells what happened. The king lost his mind. He was kicked out and lived like a wild animal in the fields, eating grass, for seven years.

That scares me. Not because I think God is mean, but because it shows how serious pride is. It shows that God will not let it go on forever. He will bring us down—one way or another. Either we choose to be humble, or He will make us humble.

## My Own Embarrassing Moment

I need to tell you about something that happened to me. Something really embarrassing. Something that taught me this same lesson the hard way.

A while back, I had to give a speech to some parents. I worked really hard on it. I practiced over and over. I fixed every word. I felt really good about it.

The day came, and I was standing backstage, about to go up. I felt confident. I thought, “This is going to be great. Everyone is going to love this.”

But there was one thing I forgot to do. I did not pray. I did not ask God for help. I just trusted that I had prepared well enough.

I walked up to speak and started talking. Things were going fine at first. But then, right in the middle of my speech, my mind went completely blank. I could not remember what to say next. I stood there in front of everyone, trying to remember, but nothing came. I tried to keep talking, jumping around from one point to another, but I knew it was a mess.

When I sat down, I felt like a complete failure. So embarrassed. So disappointed in myself.

But right then, God spoke to my heart. It was like He was saying, “You trusted yourself more than you trusted Me. You thought your practice and your smart words were enough. But you forgot to ask Me for help.”

I realized I had been doing exactly what Nebuchadnezzar did. Standing around feeling proud of my own work, thinking I could do it all by myself.

**Proverbs 16:18** says, *“Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall.”* (NLT)

I did not fall down physically. But I definitely fell. And I needed it.

## God Gives Back What He Takes Away

Here is the good part of Daniel 4. After seven years of living like an animal, Nebuchadnezzar looked up to heaven. And when he did, his mind came back. His kingdom came back. His honor came back. **Daniel 4:36** says he even became greater than before.

God did not just forgive him. He gave him everything back. And even more.

That is what God does. He breaks us down to build us back up. He makes us humble so He can lift us up later.

After my embarrassing speech, I made a decision. From that day on, before every speech, every meeting, every important talk, I pray. I ask God for help. I say, “Lord, I cannot do this without You. Please give me the right words. Please help me.”

And guess what? God gave me more chances to speak. More opportunities. But this time, I did it differently. With less pride. Asking for His help.

And something cool happened. The words came easier. The message connected better. Sometimes I even said things I had not planned to say, and those were exactly the words people needed to hear.

My failure did not ruin everything. It actually made things better. Just like Nebuchadnezzar became even greater after he was humbled, God gave me back what I thought I lost. But this time, I was trusting Him, not myself.

**Joel 2:25** says, *“The LORD says, ‘I will give you back what you lost.'”* (NLT)

God keeps that promise. He gives back what pride took away—if we come back to Him and stop being so proud.

## Questions I Ask Myself Now

Since that day, I try to live differently. I ask myself hard questions:

Am I taking credit for stuff God did?

When God warns me about something, do I actually change, or do I just say “okay” and keep doing the same thing?

Do I pray before I do things, or only after I already messed up?

Am I willing to be humble now, or am I waiting for God to embarrass me first?

Every morning before work, I pray. Before meetings, I pray. Before hard decisions, I ask God what to do. Not because I am super religious, but because I know what happens when I do not. I know how fast I go back to being proud. I know how easy it is to forget I need Him.

I do not want to be like Nebuchadnezzar, needing seven years of living like a crazy person before I look up. I want to look up every single day.

**James 4:10** says, *“Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.”* (NLT)

That verse reminds me every day. When I am humble first, God lifts me up. When I admit I need Him, He gives me what I need—the right words, the right choices, the right attitude.

## A God Who Does Not Give Up

What really amazes me about Daniel 4 is that God did not give up on Nebuchadnezzar. Even after all the king’s pride and showing off, even after ignoring all the warnings, God still reached him. God still gave him everything back.

If God could reach a proud king who thought he was so great, He can reach anyone. He can reach me when I start thinking I am so great. And the people I pray for who seem so far away from God? He can reach them too.

His patience is bigger than my pride. His love is stronger than my stubbornness.

Today, I choose to look up. Not because I have everything figured out. Not because I stopped being proud forever. But because I know what happens when I look down—when I only think about myself, my skills, my plans.

I want to look up to the God who gives me everything. The God who is patient with me when I forget. The God who does not let me stay proud, but also does not leave me down there.

**Daniel 4:37** says the king’s final words: *“Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and glorify and honor the King of heaven. All his acts are just and true, and he is able to humble the proud.”* (NLT)

I want that to be my story too. Not that I never have a pride problem, but that when I do, I remember who is really in charge. Not me. Him.

I am working on looking up first, before I mess up and have to learn the hard way.
