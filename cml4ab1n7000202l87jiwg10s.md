I have done wrong things even when I knew they were wrong. Many times, actually.

Last week, I spoke harsh words to a teacher who made an honest mistake. I knew I should be kind. I knew my words would hurt her. But I said them anyway. Later that night, I could not sleep. Why did I do that when I knew better?

That is when I read this verse: “You are his successor, O Belshazzar, and you knew all this, yet you have not humbled yourself” (Daniel 5:22, NLT).

These words from the prophet Daniel bother me. I see myself in Belshazzar’s story. He knew the truth but ignored it. Does this sound familiar? Let me tell you what happened that night in Babylon—and why it scares me.

## The Night Everything Changed

Picture this: King Belshazzar threw a big party. Daniel 5:1 (NLT) says he invited one thousand nobles, and wine was everywhere. Music played. People laughed. Everyone was having a good time.

But then Belshazzar made a terrible choice.

He told his servants to get the gold and silver cups from God’s temple in Jerusalem. His grandfather Nebuchadnezzar had taken these sacred cups years before, but at least he kept them stored away. Belshazzar? He decided to use them for his party.

Daniel 5:3-4 (NLT) tells us what happened next. They drank wine from God’s holy cups while praising their idols—gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. Dead gods that could not see or hear anything.

When I read this, I feel how bad this insult was. They mocked God with His own sacred things. This was not just being rude. This was done on purpose.

Then suddenly—the party stopped.

Daniel 5:5 (NLT) says fingers of a human hand appeared and started writing on the palace wall. Can you imagine? The music stopped. The laughter stopped. Everyone stared at those strange words appearing on the wall.

Verse 6 paints a clear picture: “The king’s face turned pale with fright. His knees knocked together in fear and his legs gave way beneath him.”

Belshazzar called all his wise men, magicians, and fortune-tellers. Nobody could read the writing. Nobody understood what it meant. Finally, the queen mother remembered Daniel—the man who had explained dreams for Nebuchadnezzar years ago.

When Daniel arrived, Belshazzar promised him rewards if he could read the message. But Daniel refused the gifts. He had something more important to say.

Daniel reminded Belshazzar about his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar. God had made Nebuchadnezzar powerful, but when pride filled his heart, God humbled him. For seven years, Nebuchadnezzar lived like an animal, eating grass in the fields, until he finally said yes to God’s power over everything.

Then came the words that still stay in my mind.

Daniel 5:22 says: “You are his successor, O Belshazzar, and you knew all this, yet you have not humbled yourself.”

You knew. You knew all this. But you did not humble yourself.

Those words hurt me. Daniel was not saying, “You should have known.” He was saying, “You DID know—and you ignored it anyway.”

Daniel read the strange writing: “MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN.” The meaning? God has counted your days. You have been weighed on the scales and found not enough. Your kingdom will be divided and given to others.

Daniel 5:30 (NLT) tells us what happened next: “That very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian king, was killed.”

No second chance. No tomorrow. His knowledge could not save him.

## What Did Belshazzar Really Know?

Here is what bothers me most about Daniel 5:22. Daniel did not say Belshazzar might have known or could have known. He said Belshazzar really knew. This was clear knowledge that brought responsibility.

So what exactly did Belshazzar know?

**He knew God gives power to kings.** Daniel 5:18 (NLT) reminded him that God had given power, greatness, glory, and honor to his grandfather. Belshazzar did not earn his throne—he got it from his family. Every bit of his authority came from God.

But he used that God-given power to mock God. He threw a party that dishonored the One who gave him everything.

I feel guilty about this. God gave me my position as a school administrator. Every day I work with teachers and students, I am using authority God gave me. When I use this position for my own pride or comfort instead of serving others, I am like Belshazzar. I know better. But do I always act on what I know?

**He knew pride gets punished.** Daniel 5:20-21 (NLT) reminded Belshazzar about Nebuchadnezzar’s experience. He knew the complete story. Pride made his grandfather live like an animal for seven years. He had a real example right in his own family.

Yet Belshazzar threw the proudest, most arrogant party you can imagine. He thought he could escape what his grandfather could not.

I have learned this lesson too. In a previous article, I shared about the time my mind went completely blank during a speech to parents. God humbled me that day. He taught me I need the Holy Spirit’s help, not just my own preparation.

But here is my problem—I keep forgetting. Last month, I had another presentation. I felt confident. I had prepared well. And I caught myself thinking, “I can do this.” That is dangerous thinking. That is forgetting the lesson. I am like Belshazzar, doing the same mistake again.

**He knew sacred things must be honored.** Daniel 5:2 (NLT) clearly says that Belshazzar knew those cups came from the temple in Jerusalem. They were not ordinary cups. They were set apart for worshiping the true God.

Daniel 5:23 (NLT) pointed out his choice: “You have praised gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone—gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all.” He chose dead idols over the living God. This was not an accident. This was done on purpose.

This makes me ask hard questions. What has God given me that is sacred, but I sometimes treat like it is common? My calling as an educator—do I treat it as holy work or just a job? My family—do I honor them as God’s gift or take them for granted? Sabbath worship—is it sacred time or just routine?

I know these things are holy. But my actions do not always show it.

**He knew God sees everything.** This is the most powerful thing in Daniel 5:23: “But you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny!”

Every breath Belshazzar took was a gift from God. Every heartbeat was in God’s hands. And God saw everything happening at that party.

This truth comforts me and scares me at the same time. It comforts me because God sees when I am trying to do right, even when nobody else notices. But it scares me because God also sees when I know the truth but choose to ignore it. He sees when I pray one thing but live another way.

The final words came in Daniel 5:27 (NLT): “You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.”

Belshazzar had knowledge, but he did not obey. And here is the principle that shakes me: Luke 12:48 (NLT) says, “From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded.” The more we know, the more responsible we are to obey.

## The Mistakes I Might Do Again

When I read about Belshazzar, I do not see some ancient king far away from me. I see myself. I see the same temptations, the same struggles. Let me be honest about the mistakes I might do again.

**Mistake #1: Using God’s blessings for my own pride.** Belshazzar took sacred things and used them for his own glory. He turned holy cups into party cups.

Here is my problem. God blessed me with a leadership position. When parents praise me for our school’s achievements, I feel a dangerous satisfaction. Sometimes I smile and accept the compliments without giving credit to God or my hard-working teachers. In those moments, I am using God’s blessings for my own pride. I know I should point praise to God. But pride makes me want to keep it.

**Mistake #2: Forgetting lessons I already learned.** Belshazzar knew his grandfather’s story but acted like it would never happen to him. He learned nothing from history.

I do this too. Remember that podium experience I talked about? God taught me to depend on the Holy Spirit, not my abilities. But last month, I caught myself preparing for a meeting and thinking, “I do not need to pray about this. I know what to do.” That is forgetting. That is drifting away.

Hebrews 2:1 (NLT) warns: “We must pay the most careful attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.” Drifting is exactly what I do. I learn the lesson, then slowly drift back to trusting myself.

**Mistake #3: Delayed obedience.** Belshazzar had years to humble himself. He could have learned from Nebuchadnezzar. He could have honored God at any time. But he waited. And that very night, Daniel 5:30 (NLT) says, he was killed. No tomorrow. No second chance.

This is my most dangerous temptation. I know what God wants me to do, but I tell myself, “I will do it later.” I will pray more tomorrow. I will apologize when I have time. I will change that habit after this busy season.

I know I need to spend more time in morning prayer. I know I need to ask forgiveness from that colleague I spoke to harshly months ago. But I keep waiting because I think I have time. James 4:14 (NLT) reminds me, “You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.”

Belshazzar thought he had time. He died that night. I may not have tomorrow either.

## What I Will Do Differently

Knowing is not enough. James 2:19 (NLT) says even demons believe in God and shake with fear. What matters is what I do with what I know.

Here is my commitment—and I invite you to join me.

**Action #1: Practice daily humility.** James 4:10 (NLT) says, “Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.” Humility is not a one-time event. It is a daily choice.

Every morning before I check my phone or read emails, I pray. My prayer is simple: “Lord, this day belongs to You. My position belongs to You. I am Your servant.” Before every meeting, I whisper, “Holy Spirit, guide my words.” Before important decisions, I ask, “God, what do You want, not what makes me look good?”

This daily practice reminds me I am not in control. It keeps me depending on God, not on my own strength.

**Action #2: Keep a record of God’s faithfulness.** Psalm 103:2 (NLT) says, “Let all that I am praise the LORD; may I never forget the good things he does for me.”

We forget so easily. So I keep a journal where I write down answered prayers and moments when God helped me. When pride tempts me, I read past entries. I read about the podium experience when my memory failed. I read about times when God provided what I needed. My journal is personal proof that goes against pride. It reminds me that every success came from God’s help, not my own power.

**Action #3: Obey immediately when God convicts me.** James 4:17 (NLT) says, “Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.” Delayed obedience is disobedience.

When the Holy Spirit convicts me during prayer or Bible reading, I need to act that same day. If I need to apologize, I should do it right away, not wait until later. If I need to make things right with someone, I should not delay. Waiting makes it harder to obey.

## My Final Thought

Belshazzar knew everything but did nothing. That cost him his life and his kingdom. Daniel 5:22 still echoes in my mind: “You knew all this, yet you have not humbled yourself.”

I know things too. About pride. About humility. About obeying God. The question is not “What do I know?” It is “What will I do with what I know?”

I do not want to be weighed on God’s scales and found not enough like Belshazzar was.

What about you? What do you know that you are not doing? What lesson have you learned but forgotten? What obedience are you waiting to do?

Let us not wait until it is too late. God gives us today to humble ourselves. Let us use it.
